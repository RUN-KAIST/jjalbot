## How to setup your local development environment

**Writing still in progress!**

1. Activate your own virtual environment. 
The recommended way is to use [Poetry](https://github.com/sdispater/poetry). 

2. Install required project dependencies. With Poetry, it is as simple as `poetry install`. 
Or you can just `pip install -r requirements.txt`.

3. Prepare your own [Slack app](https://api.slack.com/apps).
